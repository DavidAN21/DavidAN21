# About Me

I'm **David Andrey Nugroho**, an Information Technology student at **Tidar University**, a **Frontend Developer**, and an **IoT Developer** who enjoys creating modern, responsive, and user-focused digital solutions.  
Iâ€™m passionate about combining design, code, and connected technologies to build interactive and meaningful experiences.  

My work focuses on crafting clean and efficient web interfaces while exploring how IoT systems can integrate with intelligent environments.  
Recently, Iâ€™ve also been learning about **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**, and Iâ€™m deeply interested in how artificial intelligence can be applied to enhance web and IoT technologies.  
I believe that technology should not only solve problems but also make life simpler and more engaging.
